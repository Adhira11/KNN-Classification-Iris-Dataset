**# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification 🌐

## Objective
To implement and analyze K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using Scikit-learn on a classification problem.

## Tasks Completed
- ✅ Used the Iris dataset and normalized features
- ✅ Applied `KNeighborsClassifier` from Scikit-learn
- ✅ Tested K values: 1, 3, 5, 7
- ✅ Evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix
- ✅ Visualized decision boundaries for K=5

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python knn_classifier.py
